From net flows to perp funding, the metrics that explain this bull cycle better than “number go up.” Bitcoin (BTC) price movements are now being pulled by off-chain flows and leverage, not just by classic on-chain signals.
Since January 2024, when US spot Bitcoin ETFs launched, the variables that explain why BTC rips or dumps have quietly reshuffled. On-chain metrics now describe how tight the spring is, not whether someone is pulling the trigger.
The trigger sits in ETF flows, perpetual swap funding, stablecoin liquidity, and macro shocks transmitted through institutional portfolios.
Here are the five signals that actually move BTC in the ETF era.
A joint market review byGeminiandGlassnodepublishedin February 2025estimated that spot ETFs had accumulated more than 515,000 BTC, about 2.4 times the amount miners issued over the same period.
Additionally, a study by Mieszko Mazur and Efstathios Polyzos found that capital flows into US spot ETFs are thesingle most crucial factorin predictingBitcoin’svaluation, more explanatory than traditional crypto variables.
The first quarter of 2024 saw roughly $12.1 billion in net inflows into the new US spot ETFs, a period that coincided with BTC breaking its prior all-time high.
In November 2025, net redemptions totaled around $3.7 billion, the heaviest monthly outflows since launch, as BTC slid from above $126,000 to the high-$80,000s.
Glassnode’s November reports frame ETF flow softness as acore reason BTC slippedbelow key cost-basis bands, with spot order flow “exceptionally sensitive” to relatively small incremental flows in a thin market.
A $500 million IBIT outflow day is now as meaningful as any on-chain whale move.
Derivatives data from major venues likeBitMEX,Binance, andBybitshow funding clustering around a neutral band in this cycle, with far fewer blow-off extremes than in 2017 or 2021. Yet, spikes still line up with local tops and liquidations.
Funding around 8% to 12% annualized is now in equilibrium. Spikes well above that precede local tops, while profoundly negative funding marks cycle lows and forced unwinds.
A 2025 SSRN paper by Emre Inan found that BTC perpetual funding on Binance and Bybit showspredictability in funding ratesrather than price returns. Nevertheless, it helps forecast the next funding print, which adds data to check for the next BTC move.
As ETF flows turned modestly negative in November, Glassnode observed falling futures open interest, cycle-low funding, and sharp repricing of downside options.
Price impulses now look like a joint product of ETF flows and derivatives positioning. When ETF inflows surge but funding stays subdued, that is durable demand.
When funding spikes to over 20% annualized while ETF flows stall, that is leverage chasing momentum, and it unwinds fast.
Stablecoin supply and exchange balances still align neatly with BTC price movements.
Bursts of stablecoin supply growth and rising exchange balances have historically preceded or accompanied major BTC rallies, while flat or negative stablecoin growth has front-run corrections.
CEX.IO’s January 2025 reviewshows stablecoin supply grew about 59%in 2024 and reached roughly 1% of the US dollar money supply, with transfer volume of $27.6 trillion that year.
Periods of strong ETF inflows paired with expanding stablecoin supply deliver the strongest rallies. When both go net negative, downside moves are faster and deeper.
ETF flows are the front door for institutions, while stablecoins set how much marginal firepower crypto-native traders can bring to a move.
Glassnode and Avenir’s June 2025 report notes that the share of BTC held by long-term holders reached historic highs into early 2025, tightening float, but that a rising “Hot Capital Share” of short-term, price-sensitive supply to roughly 38% has made the market acutely reactive to new flows.
Additionally, Glassnode’s November reports link recent price action to long-term holder (LTH) behavior: BTC slipping below key realized-price bands coincided with LTHs starting todistribute into ETF and CEX demand, weakening support.
21Sharesargues that before 2024, you couldtell the storyof Bitcoin cycles with on-chain cohort and cost-basis metrics alone. After ETFs, you need to combine those with ETF flows, derivatives, and macro.
Watching where supply sits, LTH versus STH, in-profit bands, realized price, is a way to understand how elastic the tape is, then pair that with ETF and derivatives data to explain why the same dollar of buying now moves BTC more or less than before.
The ETF era has tightened Bitcoin’s link tomacro liquidityand real yields. Ainslie Wealth’sSeptember 2025 analysisfinds BTC historically responds with a 5x to 9x beta to changes in a composite global liquidity index, versus roughly 2x to 3x for gold and about 1x for equities.
A 2025 macro-finance paper concludes that Bitcoin showed increasing sensitivity to interest-rate expectations and liquidity shocks, behaving more like a high-beta macro asset.
Deutsche Bankanalysts argue that the current drawdown isharder to recoverfrom because BTC is now deeply embedded in institutional portfolios via ETFs, and those portfolios are being de-risked amid macro headwinds and higher real yields.
21Shares ties the autumn sell-off to tightening liquidity and fading rate-cut hopes, framing ETF flows as the transmission channel between macro and BTC.
Rate-cut odds, dollar liquidity indices, and US real-yield moves now show up almost immediately in ETF flows, which then feed back into spot and derivatives.
The five signals are gears in the same machine.
ETF flows set the baseline institutional bid. Perp funding reveals whether that bid is being amplified or opposed by leverage. Stablecoin liquidity determines whether crypto-native traders can absorb or front-run institutional flows. Holder regimes set the tape’s elasticity. Macro liquidity governs the availability and cost of capital, which feed into all four.
When all five align, BTC rips. When they misalign, BTC dumps.
The ETF era made Bitcoin more like a traditional risk asset with crypto-specific plumbing. If Bitcoin reaches $3 trillion in market cap, it will be because all five signals fired in the same direction.
