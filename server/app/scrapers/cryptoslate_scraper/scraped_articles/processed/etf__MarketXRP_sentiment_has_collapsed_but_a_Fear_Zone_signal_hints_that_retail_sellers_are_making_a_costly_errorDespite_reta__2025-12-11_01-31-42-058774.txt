Despite retail panic, XRP's on-chain momentum signals growing institutional confidence in the digital asset.

XRPis showing one of the clearest splits in crypto this quarter between what people say and what they do with their money.
Social data tracking bullish and bearish commentary indicates that the mood around the asset has entered a new Fear zone, even as theXRP Ledger (XRPL)logs its most active stretch of 2025 and regulated products continue to attract inflows.
The split recalls late November, when a similar spike in retail pessimism preceded a brief rebound. However, the current backdrop features heavier selling pressure and larger flows through institutional channels, widening the gap between user sentiment and observable market activity.
Data from Santiment shows that XRP entered a Fear zone this week, marking the second time in three weeks that bearish commentary has outweighed bullish discussion by an abnormal margin.
The shift follows a31% price decline over the past two months,which pushed the token to as low as $2 before its recovery to $2.15.
This period triggered the sharpest negative sentiment reading since Nov. 21 and also coincided with a short-lived recovery.
At the same time, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is recording a rise in transactional intensity.
On-chaindatafromCryptoQuantshowed that on Dec. 2, the network’s velocity metric reached 0.0324, its highest level this year.
Velocity measures how frequently units of an asset move between addresses, offering a gauge of turnover rather than supply. Elevated readings generally reflect active markets in which coins circulate rapidly rather than sitting in long-term storage.
In declining markets, high velocity can appear during periods when holders move coins to exchanges. It can also signal that liquidity providers and larger participants are absorbing supply as valuations reset.
Regardless of motive, the metric shows that XRP is being used at a faster rate than earlier in the year, with 2025 shaping up to be one of the network’s most active periods.
While retail commentary has turned negative, fund flows into spot exchange-traded products have moved in the opposite direction.
Per SoSoValue ETFdata, XRP products added roughly $12.84 million on Dec. 4. Solana products drew about $4.59 million.
Over the same window,Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflowsof approximately $194.64 million, and Ethereum products shed around $41.57 million.
The pattern aligns with a rotation that has developed over the past several weeks, during which inflows have shifted toward mid-cap assets even as benchmarks lag.
As a result, XRP ETFs have seen inflows of about $887 million since launch, making it thestrongest performing crypto ETF relative to peers.
The move does not necessarily indicate a structural shift, but the contrast with social sentiment is notable.
Retail commentary remains dominated by concerns around price performance, while ETF investors—who often operate under defined mandates and longer horizons—continue to allocate through regulated channels.
The overlap between rising velocity and steady ETF interest suggests that institutional exposures have not weakened despite the drawdown.
Undergirding this institutional bid is a structural shift inRipple’s business model.
On Dec. 4, the companystatedthat it has deployed nearly $4 billion in 2025 across a series of acquisitions designed to pivot XRP from a speculative asset to a settlement utility for corporate finance.
The firm’s strategy appears to be the vertical integration of value transfer.
The $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury attempts to insert digital asset rails directly into existing corporate cash management workflows. This is supported by the purchase of Rail for stablecoin payment routing and Palisade for institutional-grade custody.
Perhaps most significant for market structure is the integration of Ripple Prime, the institutional brokerage arm acquired from Hidden Road.
This move completes the stack by offering execution, clearing, and financing for OTC trading. By owning the custody (Palisade), the execution (Ripple Prime), and the client interface (GTreasury), Ripple is building aclosed-loop liquidity environment.
It stated:
“Together, they bring Ripple closer to owning the full financial plumbing behind global value movement, which means our clients have access to the full suite of digital assets capabilities that make their business faster, more efficient, and future-proof: custody, liquidity, payout networks, treasury management, prime brokerage services and real-time settlement.”
The current setup places XRP at an intersection where crowd emotion and market activity diverge.
Retail traders, driven by the “Fear” signals in Santiment’s data, are extrapolating recent price drops into a permanent decline.
Meanwhile, the data-driven participants, ETF issuers, and infrastructure builders are treating the volatility as a liquidity event to deepen their positions.
History suggests that when sentiment and flows diverge this sharply, the flows eventually dictate the price. As such, one can deduce that XRP’s price would subsequently rise given its positive fundamentals.
