Despite a downgrade from S&P, Tether's gold and Bitcoin stockpile is seen as strength by crypto markets.

Tether, the issuer of theUSDTstablecoin, has spent the past year accumulating Bitcoin and gold at a pace that puts it on par with several sovereign treasuries.
For context, the firm purchased more gold than every central bank combined over the last quarter alone, pushing its total holdings to 116 tons of physical bullion.
Yet the build-up has not impressed traditional finance.
On Nov. 26, credit rating firm S&P Globaldowngradedits assessment of USDT’s ability to maintain its dollar peg to a 5, the lowest score in its stablecoin rating structure.
The agency pointed to rising allocations to Bitcoin, secured loans, and other higher-risk instruments, and said these exposures create uncertainty around reserve liquidity. In S&P’s view, these assets’ accumulation sits outside the simple, dollar-denominated model that a stablecoin reserve should reflect.
The result is an unusual split. Tether is buying assets that central banks have used for centuries to signal financial strength. S&P has concluded that the mix weakens the stablecoin’s reliability.
S&P’s downgrade rests on concerns about liquidity and reserve clarity rather than about asset quality. The agency’s model evaluates whether a stablecoin issuer can meet redemptions quickly and without friction during periods of market stress.
According to the firm, Tether’s increasing allocation toBitcoinand secured loans introduces price volatility and counterparty exposure. The firm holds approximately $10 billion in BTC and has around $15 billion in secured loans, according to its latest quarterly attestationreport.
At the same time, gold is also central to its reserves, with roughly $13 billion in assets. The precious metal, while a hard asset with long-term value, is harder to liquidate on short notice and cannot settle a large redemption as easily as a Treasury bill can.
Considering this, S&P’s view is that the reserve mix has become less suited to a product that promises instant one-for-one redemption.
The agency also highlighted gaps in disclosure. It noted:
“There is no public disclosure about the type of assets eligible for inclusion in USDT’s reserves or the action to be followed if the value of one of the underlying assets or asset classes were to drop significantly.”
Moreover, Tether does not publish detailed information on custodians, counterparties, or the composition of its money-market exposures.
These omissions matter because the quality of those institutions directly affects the reliability of reserves.
Even though Tether’s US Treasury holdings exceed $130 billion, making it one of the largest holders globally, the lack of transparency into its operational plumbing limits S&P’s confidence.
Notably, Tether has defended its approach in the past by presenting a different macro thesis.
Paolo Ardoino, the firm’s chief executive officer, hasarguedthat Bitcoin, gold, and land are long-term hedges against global instability and the erosion of sovereign balance sheets.
The company has backed that view with investments in mining and royalty companies, a growing tokenized-gold business, and partnerships to offer vault services and collateralized lending tied to gold.
In a direct response to S&P’s downgrade, Ardoinosaid,
“We wear your loathing with pride… The traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system.”
From Tether’s standpoint, these moves strengthen the corporate balance sheet even if they deviate from the conventional stablecoin reserve model.
Meanwhile, the market’s interpretation of Tether differs sharply from S&P’s framework.
This is because USDT has maintained its dollar peg across ten years of market cycles, including collapses in exchanges, lenders, andrival stablecoins. That track record shapes user trust more than a formal rating ever could.
Moreover, USDT’s liquidity on global trading venues is deep. The digital asset remains the base pair for much of crypto trading and is widely used for payments in emerging markets that lack stable access to the dollar.
As a result, the stablecoin’s demand continues to rise, andUSDT’s market capitalizationis at an all-time high of more than $184 billion.
Meanwhile, the most significant feature of Tether’s balance sheet is its earnings power. With more than$130 billion in short-term US bills,the stablecoin issuer earns about $15 billion a year.
That yield creates a rapidly growing equity cushion that can absorbprice swings in Bitcoinor secured loans more effectively than standard risk models assume.
For traders and emerging-market users, these details matter more than S&P’s view of asset mix. The market sees a company with substantial US Treasury exposure, a rising gold reserve, a profitable business model, and a stable redemption mechanism.
So, even if part of the reserve is allocated to volatile assets, the scale of Tether’s retained earnings provides a buffer that would be unusual for a regulated bank.
Indeed, Ardoino underlined the extent of the firm’s innovation in an X post, saying that Tether has developed what he described as an overcapitalized business with no impaired reserves, and that it remains highly profitable.
He also added that Tether’s performance highlights weaknesses in traditional finance, which he said is increasingly unsettled by the company’s model.
He added:
“The traditional finance propaganda machine is growing worried when any company tries to defy the force of gravity of the broken financial system. No company should dare to decouple itself from it.”
Transparency still matters
Still, none of this removes the need for clearer disclosures.
The main vulnerability inTether’s structureis not its gold allocation or its Bitcoin exposure. It is the lack of detailed insight into how the reserves are custodied, how counterparties are selected, and how secured loans are managed.
Even a balance sheet supported by significant equity buffers and hard assets is harder to evaluate without transparent reporting.
For institutional users and regulators, this is the central unresolved issue.
Thus, greater visibility would reduce uncertainty for large holders and align USDT with the standards expected of a global settlement asset.
